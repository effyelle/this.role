                        Immersing oneself in role-playing games... In my opinion, it is an experience that surpasses
                        reading a good book. It is stimulating to imagine and breathe life into a character, rather than
                        receiving them predetermined, exploring alternative lives and perspectives. It is truly
                        thrilling to immerse myself in the stories, or even worlds, imagined by my friends, where the
                        consequences of my decisions depend on rolling a die... or two. However, at times this
                        experience can be blurred by an immense amount of rules and lengthy calculations, as well as the
                        lack of physical resources like manuals, maps, and figurines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That is why I have created an application that provides users with a platform to create and
                        participate in game sessions, featuring functionalities such as character sheet creation, a chat
                        for recording dice rolls, and interactive maps to move character tokens. The idea is to
                        facilitate automatic calculation of statistics, note-taking, storage of skill information, and
                        dynamic dice rolls with their corresponding statistics or modifiers. I have chosen to implement
                        Dungeons & Dragons, one of the most famous and my personal favourite role-playing games at the
                        moment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In summary, my application aims to provide a smoother and more comprehensive experience for
                        role-playing enthusiasts, offering tools that streamline and enhance their immersion in the
                        captivating world of Dungeons & Dragons.
